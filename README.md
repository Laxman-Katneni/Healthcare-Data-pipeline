# 🏥 Healthcare Data Pipeline & Dashboard

An **end-to-end data engineering and analytics project** simulating real-world healthcare operations.  
This system extracts synthetic hospital data, transforms it into analytics-ready datasets, loads it into a warehouse (SQLite/PostgreSQL), and visualizes KPIs in an interactive dashboard.

Designed for **Data Engineering, BI Reporting, and Healthcare Analytics** use cases — inspired by real workflows in hospital data teams.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **ETL Pipeline** (Python + Pandas + SQLAlchemy)  
  - Extracts CSV/relational data (patients, diagnoses, admissions)  
  - Cleans, joins, and calculates **business-critical KPIs**  
  - Loads into **SQLite** by default or **PostgreSQL** (Docker-ready)
  
- **Healthcare KPIs**:
  - **30-Day Readmission Rate** — quality of care metric
  - **Average Length of Stay (LOS)** — efficiency & cost indicator
  - **Admissions by Diagnosis** — case mix analysis
  - **Daily Census** — hospital bed utilization proxy

- **Interactive Dashboard** (Streamlit)
  - View KPIs, bar charts, and trend lines
  - Supports multiple database backends

- **Cloud-Ready Architecture**
  - Switch to **PostgreSQL** with environment variables
  - Schema compatible with GCP BigQuery or AWS Redshift

## 📊 Sample Dashboard

**KPIs:**  
- 30-Day Readmission Rate  
- Average LOS (days)  
- Admissions by Primary Diagnosis (Top 10)  
- Daily Inpatient Census Trend  

The dashboard updates automatically when the ETL pipeline is re-run.
